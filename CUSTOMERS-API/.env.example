# RAILWAY DEPLOYMENT: These are auto-set by Railway
# ============================================
# On Railway, the following variables are automatically injected:
# RAILWAY_DATABASE_HOST=your-railway-mysql-host
# RAILWAY_DATABASE_USER=your-railway-user
# RAILWAY_DATABASE_PASSWORD=your-railway-password
# RAILWAY_DATABASE_NAME=your-railway-database
# PORT=8080 (or whatever Railway assigns)

# The application will automatically detect and use Railway variables
# if they exist, falling back to DB_* variables for local development.
# No changes needed to this file for Railway deployment!
